# Mini_DE_project_1

The goal of this tiny Data Engineering project is to create a data pipeline that computes operations from a text file and appends the results to another text file.



## Deployment

To execute the data pipeline type the command line in Powershell: 

```
  python generate_data.py ; cat input_file.txt | python compute.py
```
